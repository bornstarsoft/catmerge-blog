The upcoming release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is set to make waves, not just for its gameplay but also for its staggering file size. At nearly 95GB, this title will occupy almost 40% of the Nintendo Switch 2's base storage, raising eyebrows among gamers who are accustomed to more compact AAA titles on the platform.

While other major releases like Hogwarts Legacy and Cyberpunk 2077 have managed to fit within more modest file sizes, Square Enix's ambitious RPG pushes the limits of what players can store on their consoles. The developers have emphasized that maintaining high-quality graphics, particularly in lighting, was crucial for the Switch 2 version, ensuring that the game does not compromise on visual fidelity despite the size.

As we approach the January 22 release date, it will be interesting to see how players adapt to this new storage challenge. Will this massive file size deter gamers from downloading the title, or will the allure of a high-quality RPG outweigh the storage concerns? Only time will tell.
