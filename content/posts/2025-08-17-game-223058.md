In a surprising turn of events, the Standard Edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is reportedly set to cost $69.99 in the US, contrary to earlier expectations that it would be priced at $80. This revelation comes from the reliable insider billbil-kun, who has a proven track record of accurate gaming news. With the games release date tentatively set for November 14, this pricing strategy could significantly impact gamers' purchasing decisions, especially with the competitive landscape shaped by Battlefield 6's upcoming launch.

The decision to price Black Ops 7 at $69.99 rather than $80 may be a strategic move by Microsoft to maintain its competitive edge in the gaming market. With Battlefield 6 also priced at $69.99, Microsoft seems to be positioning Black Ops 7 as a more appealing option for gamers. This could be crucial, especially considering the recent success of Battlefield 6's Open Beta, which saw over 500,000 concurrent players on Steam.

As we approach the release of Black Ops 7, it will be interesting to see how this pricing strategy plays out in the market. Will it sway gamers away from Battlefield 6, or will the competition remain fierce?
