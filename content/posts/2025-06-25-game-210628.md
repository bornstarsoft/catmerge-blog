Playing games at 30 frames per second (FPS) on consoles can have unexpected consequences, as highlighted by a recent experience with Death Stranding 2. After years of gaming primarily on PC, where 60 FPS is often the standard, transitioning back to a console game with a lower frame rate led to physical discomfort, including headaches. This phenomenon raises questions about how frame rates impact our gaming experience and overall well-being.

The discomfort experienced while playing Death Stranding 2 can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the game's camera responsiveness and the player's acclimatization to higher frame rates. As gamers, we often take for granted the smoothness and immediacy of our inputs when playing at 60 FPS or higher. The jarring transition back to 30 FPS can create a disconnect between what we see and what our brains expect, leading to feelings of nausea or discomfort.

Fortunately, Death Stranding 2 offers a performance mode that locks the frame rate at 60 FPS, alleviating these issues and allowing for a more enjoyable gaming experience. This situation underscores the importance of customizable graphics settings in games, particularly for console titles, and highlights the need for developers to consider how frame rates affect player comfort. As gaming technology continues to evolve, will we see a shift towards higher frame rates becoming the norm across all platforms?
