Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has not only become the best-selling Warhammer game of all time, with over 7 million copies sold, but it has also set a new benchmark for video games based on the iconic franchise. Games Workshop recently highlighted this achievement in their financial report, emphasizing that the game has successfully transitioned the brand from its traditional niche PC roots to a broader console audience.

The company noted that while Space Marine 2 has thrived on PC, it is primarily viewed as a console game, showcasing the potential for Warhammer IP to reach new heights. With plans for further console and mobile opportunities, along with the early development of Space Marine 3, the future looks bright for fans of the franchise. As Games Workshop continues to explore new avenues, one can't help but wonder what innovative experiences await in the Warhammer universe.
