Nintendo has just announced that the beloved GameCube classic, Luigi's Mansion, will be making its way to the Switch 2's Nintendo Classics library on October 30, just in time for Halloween. This iconic title, originally released in 2001, features Luigi as he bravely explores a haunted mansion in search of his missing brother, Mario, armed with the quirky Poltergust 3000 vacuum.

This addition marks a significant milestone for fans, as it will be the first time all three Luigi's Mansion games are playable on a single console. Players can now enjoy the original GameCube version alongside the remastered Luigi's Mansion 2 HD and the latest installment, Luigi's Mansion 3. With this update, the Switch 2's library continues to grow, joining other classic titles like F-Zero GX and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

For those eager to relive the spooky adventures, a wireless GameCube controller is available for purchase, enhancing the nostalgic experience. As Nintendo hints at more GameCube titles on the horizon, including Super Mario Sunshine and Pokmon classics, the excitement for Switch 2's expanding library is palpable. What other GameCube gems are you hoping to see next?
