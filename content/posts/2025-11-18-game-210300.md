In an innovative move to support unemployed youth living alone in Seoul, Korea, Korea University has partnered with the Gangnam District's Single-Person Household Community Center. This collaboration aims to provide tailored employment assistance to young individuals, addressing the growing number of jobless youth in single-person households.

The initiative, part of the university's ongoing community collaboration programs, was solidified during a recent visit to the community center. Here, representatives from Korea University explored various support programs and agreed to enhance the currently lacking employment services. The first step in this partnership will be a specialized employment seminar scheduled for the 25th, focusing on emerging hiring trends and strategies for 2026.

As this collaboration unfolds, it will not only provide immediate support but also pave the way for a more structured approach to youth employment services in the region. How will such partnerships shape the future of employment support for young people in urban areas?
