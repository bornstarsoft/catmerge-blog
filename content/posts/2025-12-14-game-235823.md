In a significant move for the gaming community, Enhance Games has announced that the online services for their popular puzzle game, Humanity, will be discontinued by the end of March 2026. This decision comes as the studio has observed a decline in user engagement, particularly in the user-generated stage-sharing feature, which has been the sole online component of the game since its release in 2023.

As of now, players can no longer share or access new user-created stages, although they can still enjoy the stages they have saved locally. The announcement highlights a broader trend in the gaming industry where online features are often tied to user engagement metrics, and when those metrics fall short, developers are forced to make tough decisions.

With over 30,000 stages created by the community over the past two and a half years, the discontinuation of this feature raises questions about the future of user-generated content in gaming. Will we see more studios follow suit, or will there be a resurgence in community-driven content creation? Only time will tell.
