Stellar Blade, the post-apocalyptic action-adventure game developed by Shift Up, has taken the gaming world by storm, selling over three million units globally. This remarkable achievement includes a staggering one million units sold on PC within just three days of its release, setting a new benchmark for single-player console games from Korea. The rapid success of the PC version is particularly noteworthy, as it outpaced the PlayStation 5 version, which took nearly two months to reach the same milestone.

The game's launch on Steam saw an impressive peak of 192,078 concurrent players, highlighting its immediate popularity among gamers. Released for the PlayStation 5 on April 26, 2024, and making its PC debut on June 11, 2025, Stellar Blade has quickly established itself as a must-play title in the current gaming landscape. This success not only reflects the game's quality and appeal but also signals a growing trend in the gaming industry where PC versions of games are gaining significant traction shortly after their console counterparts.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how Stellar Blade continues to perform and what this means for future releases from Shift Up and other developers. Will we see more games breaking sales records in the coming years? Only time will tell.
