The latest GDC survey reveals a striking trend in the gaming industry: developers are significantly more interested in creating games for the PS5 and Switch 2 than for Xbox. With only 20% of surveyed developers expressing interest in Xbox Series X/S, compared to 40% for PS5 and 39% for Switch 2, it seems that the Xbox platform is losing its appeal among game creators. This shift could have profound implications for the future of gaming and platform competition.

Interestingly, despite 40% of respondents having released their last project on Xbox, the enthusiasm for developing on this console has dwindled. Factors such as audience reach and business model success are paramount for developers, and it appears that PS5 and Switch 2 are currently seen as more viable options. As Xbox continues to position itself as a multiplatform entity, the question remains: will this strategy be enough to win back developer interest in the long run?
