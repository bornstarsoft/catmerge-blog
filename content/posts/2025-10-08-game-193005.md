NASCAR fans have been buzzing with anticipation for the release of NASCAR '25, but a recent confirmation from producer Matt Lewis has put a damper on some of that excitement. In a recent interview, Lewis revealed that the tracks in the game will be locked to their respective series, meaning players won't have the freedom to race any series on any track. This decision marks a significant departure from previous NASCAR games where players could unlock and race on various tracks, regardless of the series.

The reasoning behind this limitation stems from the complexities involved in tuning AI opponents and creating unique setups for each track and series. With four series and 30 tracks, the development team faces an overwhelming amount of work to ensure a balanced and enjoyable racing experience. While Lewis expressed disappointment over this exclusion, he hinted that it might be something to consider for future updates.

Despite the restrictions, NASCAR '25 will still feature some exciting tracks not typically associated with each series. For instance, while the ARCA Menards Series will miss several unique tracks, it will include well-known venues like Martinsville Speedway and Richmond Raceway. As the release date approaches, fans are left wondering how these changes will impact their gameplay experience and if future installments will expand the track options further.
