Indie game development team Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, for free on Steam. This unique title invites players to step into the role of a video editor tasked with creating a perfect "fake clear video" from a series of failed dungeon raids, all set against a nostalgic Windows 98 backdrop. The game cleverly combines elements of strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation, making it a refreshing addition to the indie gaming scene.

At the heart of the gameplay lies an 8-tick timeline editing system, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and strategically arrange clips to fabricate an ideal action sequence. The developers emphasize the importance of precision, stating that even a single frame of compromise can derail the illusion of victory. With engaging post-processing features, players can transform minor successes into epic moments, enhancing the overall experience.

"Don't You Trust Me?" not only offers a unique gameplay mechanic but also presents a satirical narrative that contrasts the hero's exaggerated self-promotion with the chaotic reality of their failures. As players navigate this ironic storytelling, they are left to ponder the nature of heroism and the lengths one might go to achieve glory. Will you be ready to create the ultimate fake victory?
