The recent release of iRacing's NASCAR 25 Console game marks a significant moment for NASCAR gaming enthusiasts, offering an impressive array of base paint schemes. This multi-platform title not only revives the excitement of console racing but also introduces fans to a diverse selection of drivers and their unique designs, including the long-awaited ARCA Menards Series.

While the game shines with its extensive paint scheme offerings, it does come with some notable exclusions. Fans may be disappointed to find that certain iconic sponsors, like Monster Energy and various alcoholic beverage brands, are absent from the lineup. However, the inclusion of beloved brands such as Red Bull, making its return to NASCAR gaming after more than a decade, certainly adds to the game's appeal.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how future iterations of NASCAR games build on this foundation. Will we see even more iconic sponsors and paint schemes in the next release? Only time will tell.
