Microsoft has once again raised the prices of its Xbox consoles in the US, just five months after a previous increase. This latest adjustment, effective from October 3, reflects the company's response to the "changes in the macroeconomic environment." The price hikes affect both the Xbox Series X and S models, with significant increases that could impact gamers' purchasing decisions.

The Xbox Series S 512GB and 1TB models will see price increases of $20 on top of the previous $80 hikes, while the flagship Xbox Series X will rise by an additional $50. Notably, the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Edition now costs a staggering $799.99, making it pricier than the PS5 Pro. As Microsoft maintains that prices for controllers and headsets will remain unchanged, gamers are left to ponder the implications of these new prices on their gaming budgets.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, one has to wonder: how will these price adjustments affect consumer loyalty and the overall market dynamics?
