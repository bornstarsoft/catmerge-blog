This mechanic forces players to think strategically and plan ahead, making every decision crucial.

The game features a variety of evolving mechanics that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. With hand-crafted challenges and a steady difficulty curve, players can expect a satisfying experience that combines clean pixel art with tight level design. The instant learning loop allows for quick restarts, ensuring that players can dive back into the action without frustration.
