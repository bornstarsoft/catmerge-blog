Highguard, the newly released free-to-play shooter, has made a significant splash on Steam, attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its launch day. However, this impressive player count is overshadowed by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews, revealing a stark divide between player enthusiasm and satisfaction.

Despite the excitement surrounding its announcement at The Game Awards, where it was the final reveal of the night, Highguard's reception has been mixed. Players have expressed concerns primarily about the game's large map size, which many feel is ill-suited for the 3vs3 matchups. With only 32.05% of reviews being positive, it raises questions about the game's long-term viability and the developers' ability to address player feedback.

Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio comprised of veterans from major franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's launch serves as a reminder of the challenges new IPs face in a competitive market. As the gaming community watches closely, will Wildlight be able to turn the tide and enhance player experience, or will Highguard remain a cautionary tale of unmet expectations?
