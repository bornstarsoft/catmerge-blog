In an intriguing turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed the next GameCube classics set to join the Nintendo Switch Online service. According to social media reports, an image on Walmart's website showcased a list of upcoming NSO games, prominently featuring Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2titles that have yet to be officially announced by Nintendo. This leak raises questions about whether it was a simple error or an early glimpse at Nintendo's plans.

Currently, Nintendo has confirmed only three GameCube titles for the service: Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum, with no release dates specified. The excitement surrounding the potential addition of Metroid Prime 2, especially given the recent remaster of the original Metroid Prime, could significantly enhance the appeal of the Switch Online service.

As fans eagerly await more news, the prospect of experiencing these beloved classics on modern hardware is tantalizing. Will Nintendo officially confirm these titles soon, or will they remain a mystery for a while longer? Stay tuned for updates as we keep an eye on this developing story.
