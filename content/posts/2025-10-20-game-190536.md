The gaming world is buzzing with excitement over "Linework," a groundbreaking detective puzzle game developed by the Indonesian student team OverlyUnderqualified. This 2D pixel art game redefines the detective genre by integrating narrative-driven investigation with an innovative drawing mechanic, allowing players to sketch suspects based on witness testimonies. Set against the backdrop of 1990s China, players step into the shoes of a forensic artist, piecing together clues to solve intricate crimes.

What sets Linework apart is its unique approach to gameplay. Players engage in witness interrogation, utilizing three key mechanics: presenting documents to unlock new questions, collecting clues through a dynamic note-taking system, and the central challenge of sketching suspects from often conflicting descriptions. This blend of art and deduction not only enhances the immersive experience but also encourages players to think critically and creatively.

Having gained recognition as a finalist in the student category at Gameseed 2025, OverlyUnderqualified is committed to refining Linework based on community feedback. As they continue to enhance the games mechanics and narrative depth, fans eagerly await the full release. Will you be ready to solve the mysteries of Linework when it launches?
