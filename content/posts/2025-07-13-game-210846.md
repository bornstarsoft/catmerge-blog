If youre a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost, but only until July 19, 2025. After this date, the game will transition to a paid model, costing $1.99. This unique opportunity allows players to experience the first chapter of the game without any financial commitment, making it a must-try for horror enthusiasts.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous has been designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to be free while subsequent episodes will be sold as downloadable content. Yxtopia Studios has stated that this shift to a paid model is crucial for funding future chapters and supporting server infrastructure. As the game continues to evolve, players can expect improvements and new content, including updates that enhance enemy AI and overall performance.

This transition from free to paid is not uncommon in the gaming industry, and it raises interesting questions about how indie developers can sustain their projects. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer, or are you waiting to see how the game develops? The future of Haus Of Irndrous looks promising, and its exciting to think about what lies ahead for this chilling adventure.
