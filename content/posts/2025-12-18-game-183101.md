November 2025 marked a historic low for hardware sales in the US, with only 1.6 million units sold, the worst performance since 1995. This significant drop in sales, down 27% from the previous year, can be attributed to the soaring average price of new gaming consoles, which reached an all-time high of $439. Traditionally, November is a peak month for gaming hardware sales due to Black Friday and holiday shopping, making this decline particularly alarming for the industry.

The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. However, the overall decline in hardware sales raises concerns about the future of dedicated gaming devices, especially as component prices continue to rise. With digital sales likely dominating the market, the question remains: how will console manufacturers adapt to these challenges while keeping gaming accessible to consumers?
