In a world where blockbuster titles often overshadow smaller projects, indie games like "12, Memory Lane" are proving that great experiences can come from unexpected places. Released on December 15, 2025, this free game has garnered "Very Positive" reviews on Steam, showcasing the potential of student-led development teams. With no cost to play, its a must-try for anyone looking to explore unique narratives and engaging puzzles.

Set in the haunting estate of the Villemaine family, players must unravel the mystery of their disappearance through exploration and puzzle-solving. Clocking in at just under two hours, it offers a compact yet emotionally resonant experience that rivals more extensive titles. The games design, reminiscent of classics like "What Remains of Edith Finch," highlights the creativity and talent of its developers, Forget-Me-Not Studio, a group of students from Rubika Supinfogame.

While some players have noted that the game is better suited for controllers, the overall reception has been overwhelmingly positive. As we see more indie games rise to prominence, it begs the question: what other hidden gems are waiting to be discovered in the vast world of free gaming?
