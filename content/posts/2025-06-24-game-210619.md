In a shocking turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could affect over 100 employees. This comes on the heels of a rocky launch for MindsEye, which has been plagued by technical issues and bugs, leading to a significant backlash from players and a dismal Metacritic score.

The Edinburgh-based developer has begun a 45-day consultation process, a legal requirement in the UK when laying off 100 or more staff. With approximately 300 employees based in the UK and an additional 200 overseas, the impact of these layoffs could be substantial. The situation mirrors past gaming industry crises, such as the troubled launch of Cyberpunk 2077, where player refunds became a necessity due to poor performance.

Despite the studio's commitment to improving player experience, the negative reception of MindsEye has raised questions about the future of both the game and the studio itself. As the gaming community watches closely, one has to wonder: can Build a Rocket Boy recover from this setback and regain the trust of its players?
