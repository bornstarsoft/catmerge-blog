In a surprising turn of events, Sega has inadvertently disclosed the sales figures for some of its most popular franchises, including Sonic, Persona, and Like A Dragon. This revelation, which emerged from a presentation document uploaded to Sega Sammyâ€™s investor relations website, provides a rare glimpse into the commercial performance of these beloved titles. Notably, Persona 5 Royal has achieved impressive sales of over 7 million units, while Sonic Frontiers has sold approximately 4.5 million copies.

The document, which has since been removed, also highlighted the sales of recent Yakuza titles, with Infinite Wealth and Like A Dragon shifting 1.66 million and 2.86 million units, respectively. This accidental leak not only underscores the popularity of these franchises but also raises questions about the future strategies Sega might adopt to capitalize on their successes. 

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, insights like these can inform both consumer expectations and investor confidence. What do you think this means for Sega's upcoming releases and their marketing strategies?
