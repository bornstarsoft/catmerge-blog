NINES has just revealed their upcoming title, **Pipeworks Puzzle**, and it promises to bring a fresh twist to the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. Set in a charming construction site, players will step into the shoes of a plumber tasked with arranging disordered pipe pieces to match a blueprint. With cute visuals and relaxing tunes, this game aims to offer not just a challenge, but a delightful experience that appeals to both casual and seasoned gamers alike.

The gameplay mechanics are straightforward yet engaging, as players can only move the pipes in cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right—within a grid-based arena. Adding depth to the experience is a support character named ‘Boss’, designed by the talented PokuriMio, who will guide players from novice plumbers to masters of the craft. This character adds a layer of narrative that enhances the puzzle-solving experience, making it more than just a series of challenges.

Currently, Pipeworks Puzzle can be wishlisted on Steam, and doing so may unlock exciting new features like an endless mode and multiplayer battles. A demo is also on the horizon, inviting players to dive into this whimsical world soon. As we await its release later this year, one can't help but wonder how this innovative approach will resonate with puzzle enthusiasts around the globe.
