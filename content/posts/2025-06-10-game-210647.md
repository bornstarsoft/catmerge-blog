Wilmot Works It Out offers a refreshing take on the puzzle genre, transforming the often stressful experience of gaming into a delightful and relaxing adventure. Unlike its predecessor, Wilmot’s Warehouse, this game embraces a chill atmosphere, inviting players of all ages to engage in a jigsaw puzzle experience that feels both rewarding and accessible. The game’s unique concept revolves around Wilmot, who interacts with a delivery person to receive puzzle pieces, creating a light-hearted narrative that enhances the gameplay.

As players move pieces around to complete surreal designs, the game encourages creativity while ensuring that the challenge remains enjoyable rather than overwhelming. With each completed puzzle, new pieces arrive, often leaving players with extras to use in future creations. This design choice not only keeps the gameplay flowing but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and exploration. It’s an excellent option for family gaming, as I’ve found it to be particularly fun to pass the controller around with my kids, making it a shared experience.

Wilmot Works It Out runs smoothly on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, making it accessible to a wide audience. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or just looking for a fun way to unwind, this game is a fantastic addition to your collection. What’s your favorite way to enjoy puzzle games with family or friends?
