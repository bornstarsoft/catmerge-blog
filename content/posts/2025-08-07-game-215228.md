In a significant move for the gaming community, MiHoYo has announced that support for the PS4 version of Genshin Impact will officially end in April 2026. This decision is driven by the limitations of the PS4 hardware, which can no longer accommodate the growing demands of the game, both in terms of performance and application size. The phased discontinuation begins with the game being delisted from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025, marking the end of an era for many players.

The shutdown will occur in three key phases: first, the removal of the game from the store; second, the delisting of in-game purchases; and finally, the cessation of update support. Players who have previously downloaded the game will still be able to access it, but new players will find it unavailable. MiHoYo encourages players to transition to the PS5 or other supported platforms to continue enjoying the game without interruption.

As we look ahead, this transition raises questions about the future of gaming on older consoles. Will more developers follow suit, or will there be innovative solutions to keep older platforms relevant? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the gaming landscape is evolving rapidly, and players must adapt to keep up.
