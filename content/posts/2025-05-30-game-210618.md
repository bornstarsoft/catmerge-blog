In the realm of indie gaming, few titles capture the essence of nostalgia quite like "Projected Dreams." This cozy puzzle game invites players to engage with their childhood memories by manipulating toys to create enchanting shadow plays. As you drag these toys from the shelves and drop them onto the table, the shadows they cast reveal deeper family connections and transform the environment, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.
