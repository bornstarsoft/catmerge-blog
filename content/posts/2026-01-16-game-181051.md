In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will go offline permanently on January 31, 2027. This announcement follows the game's removal from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking a significant shift in Amazon's gaming strategy as they move away from MMO development.

Players will still have access to the game they purchased until the servers shut down, but they will no longer be able to buy in-game currency starting July 20, 2026. This decision comes after a wave of layoffs at Amazon, affecting thousands of employees, including those at the New World development studio. The company expressed gratitude to its community for their dedication and passion, promising a year-long sendoff for the beloved title.

As we approach the final year of New World: Aeternum, players are left to reflect on their adventures in Aeternum. What will this mean for the MMO landscape, and how will the community come together for one last hurrah? Let's celebrate the memories and look forward to what the future holds for gaming enthusiasts everywhere.
