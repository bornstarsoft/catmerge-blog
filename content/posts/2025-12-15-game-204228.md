Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also includes a detailed manual that chronicles the game's troubled past and Oberth's career. The initiative highlights the ongoing challenges of preserving 8-bit history while supporting the archival efforts of the VGHF.

The release of Xcavator is a significant moment for retro gaming enthusiasts and collectors alike. As we witness the resurgence of forgotten titles, it raises important questions about the preservation of video game history. Will we see more lost gems from the past being unearthed and celebrated in the future? This revival not only honors the legacy of Chris Oberth but also reminds us of the importance of safeguarding our digital heritage for generations to come.
