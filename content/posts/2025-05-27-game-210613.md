Nacon has officially reclaimed the rights to the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC), marking a significant shift in the rally gaming landscape. After Electronic Arts’ Codemasters announced the end of its development on rally titles, Nacon is set to embark on a new journey with exclusive rights for the next six seasons, from 2027 to 2032. This transition promises a complete reboot of the franchise, aiming to deliver an immersive experience that resonates with both long-time rally fans and newcomers alike.

With a fresh vision in hand, Nacon's CEO Alain Falc expressed excitement about the potential to create a refined driving experience that reflects the realities of the championship. The company’s previous experience with WRC games from 2015 to 2022 has equipped them with unique insights into translating the thrill of rallying into a compelling video game format. This new venture is not just about reviving a brand; it's about elevating the entire genre of rally games.

As we look ahead, the collaboration between Nacon and WRC Promoter promises to break new ground in gaming experiences. Will this fresh approach redefine how we engage with rally games, turning them into epic adventures? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is certainly building.
