Nacon has officially regained the rights to the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC), marking a significant shift in the rally gaming landscape. After Electronic Artsâ€™ Codemasters announced the end of its development on rally titles, Nacon is set to embark on an ambitious journey to reboot the franchise. With exclusive rights for six seasons from 2027 to 2032, the company aims to deliver a fresh and immersive experience that resonates with both long-time rally fans and newcomers alike.

This reboot promises to leverage Nacon's extensive experience gained during its previous tenure with the WRC from 2015 to 2022. According to CEO Alain Falc, the new project will be driven by a passionate team dedicated to elevating rally games to unprecedented heights. The focus will be on creating a driving experience that not only reflects the realities of the championship but also captivates players through innovative gameplay and storytelling.

As we look forward to what Nacon has in store, the collaboration with WRC Promoter hints at a bright future for rally gaming. Will this new vision redefine how we experience rally racing in video games? Only time will tell, but the excitement is certainly building.
