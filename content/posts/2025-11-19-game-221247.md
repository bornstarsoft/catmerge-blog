The Game Awards 2025 might just crown a surprise winner for Game of the Year, and if history and aggregated review scores from Metacritic are any indicators, Hades 2 could take home the top honor. This years nominations have already stirred excitement, with breakout RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 leading the pack with a record 12 nominations, closely followed by the highly anticipated PlayStation titles, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, each with eight nominations.

However, a closer look at the trends reveals that the highest-rated game on Metacritic has won Game of the Year at The Game Awards in six of the last eight years. The last deviation from this trend occurred in 2019 when Sekiro triumphed over Resident Evil 2, but the pattern has been consistent for the past two years. If this trend continues, Hades 2, with its critical acclaim, could very well emerge as the unexpected champion of the night.

As we approach the awards, it will be fascinating to see if the voting aligns with these historical patterns. Will Hades 2 live up to the expectations, or will we witness another upset? The gaming community eagerly awaits the outcome.
