Mojang and King are teaming up to bring us an exciting new mobile puzzle game, Minecraft Blast, which combines the beloved mechanics of Minecraft with the addictive gameplay of Candy Crush. Currently in early testing phases, this free-to-play game is set to offer quick, casual sessions where players match blocks by color or type, making it accessible for both hardcore Minecraft fans and casual gamers alike.

In Minecraft Blast, players will have a limited number of moves to achieve their goals, utilizing various boosts like pickaxes and shovels to enhance their gameplay. The game also promises to let players unlock themed areas and build structures inspired by the iconic Minecraft universe, adding a layer of creativity to the puzzle-solving experience. As testing expands beyond Malaysia, the developers aim to gather user feedback to refine the game before its official launch.

With a dedicated team working on Minecraft Blast, fans can rest assured that this new title won't interfere with updates to the original Minecraft game. As we await the full release, the question remains: will Minecraft Blast capture the hearts of both puzzle enthusiasts and Minecraft aficionados? Let's keep an eye on this promising new addition to the gaming landscape.
