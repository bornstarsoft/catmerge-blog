As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, Netflix is making a significant leap into the world of sports gaming with its upcoming FIFA title. Led by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami, the studio Delphi Interactive is set to reimagine the FIFA series for a new generation, aiming to capture the essence of football gaming while integrating modern technology.

Merceron's experience with the Fox Engine, which powered iconic titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and eFootball, positions him uniquely to lead this ambitious project. With a focus on small, elite teams, Delphi aims to prioritize fun and accessibility, ensuring that the game appeals to both hardcore fans and casual players alike. This fresh approach comes at a pivotal time, as the FIFA brand transitions away from its long-standing partnership with EA Sports.

Scheduled for release in time for the 2026 World Cup, the Netflix FIFA game promises to deliver a unique gaming experience by utilizing televisions for gameplay while mobile devices serve as controllers. As we look forward to this innovative take on football gaming, one can't help but wonder: will this new direction redefine how we engage with sports video games?
