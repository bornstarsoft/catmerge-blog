November 2025 marked a significant moment for anime-style RPGs in the livestreaming arena, with titles like Kuro Games' Wuthering Waves and miHoYo's Zenless Zone Zero leading the charge. These games not only captivated audiences but also demonstrated the power of strategic updates and community engagement, as evidenced by their remarkable viewership spikes during major livestream events.

Wuthering Waves achieved an impressive 36.5 million viewers, a staggering 103% increase from the previous month, thanks to its Version 2.8 preview livestream. Similarly, Zenless Zone Zero saw a viewership boost of 84%, highlighting how timely content reveals can energize a game's community and attract new viewers. The success of these titles underscores the importance of platforms like Bilibili, which cater to a younger audience deeply embedded in ACGN culture.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how these trends shape future livestreaming strategies. Will we see even more innovative approaches to engage audiences in 2026?
