Capcom has unveiled an intriguing glimpse into its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics that promises to redefine gameplay in the sci-fi genre. The recently released gameplay video highlights players' ability to hack robots through a puzzle mini-game while simultaneously engaging in combat, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, Pragmata introduces players to Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, and his android companion, Diana, who intriguingly resembles a human child. This unusual pairing adds a layer of narrative depth to the gameplay, which has already garnered positive impressions from early previews. Critics have noted the demo's polished feel and its potential for expansive gameplay, raising anticipation for its release in 2026.

As Capcom continues to develop this original IP, fans are left wondering how the innovative mechanics will evolve over a lengthy gaming experience. With the studio's strong track record, there's a palpable excitement surrounding Pragmata's future. Will it set a new standard for puzzle-shooting games? Only time will tell.
