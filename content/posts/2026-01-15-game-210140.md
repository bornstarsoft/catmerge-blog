In a surprising twist, indie developer Petter Malmehed has pointed to a lack of email skills among younger players as a potential reason for the declining reviews of his puzzle game, *After Hours*. Released in 2018, the game initially found its footing but has seen a drop in both user reviews and completion rates in recent years. Malmehed's observations suggest that many young players are struggling with the game's unique email-based mechanics, which are crucial for progressing through the story.

Malmehed's findings are particularly interesting, as they highlight a generational gap in communication skills. He noted that a significant portion of player emails contained only subject lines, leaving the body empty and rendering the in-game email system ineffective. This raises important questions about how modern communication methods may be impacting gameplay and user experience in indie games.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how developers adapt to these changes in communication styles. Will we see more games that cater to the preferences of younger audiences, or will there be a resurgence of traditional mechanics that challenge players to enhance their skills? Only time will tell.
