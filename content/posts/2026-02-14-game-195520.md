The 2026 Taipei International Game Show was a vibrant showcase of gaming culture, and the "Dolls Frontline 2" booth stood out with its captivating cosplayers and engaging activities. Attendees were treated to a visual feast as they interacted with cosplayers portraying their favorite characters, creating an immersive experience that brought the game's universe to life.

At the booth, fans could participate in a Memory Puzzle Game, where their commander level in the app provided distinct advantages. The atmosphere was electric, with fans snapping photos alongside cosplayers like the stunning "Macchiato" and the playful "Suomi in swimsuit." The blend of cool and cute characters, including "Kunkai" in both her swimsuit and battle uniform, left a lasting impression on attendees.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like these not only celebrate gaming but also foster community among fans and creators. What other experiences can we expect from future gaming conventions?
