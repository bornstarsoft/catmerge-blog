Enigmo, the classic puzzle game originally launched in 2003, has been reimagined for the spatial 3D environment of the Samsung Galaxy XR. This exciting revival by Fortell Games invites players to engage in a tactile experience where they manipulate puzzle pieces in their own space to guide lasers, plasma, and water to their designated containers. With both hand tracking and controller support, the game offers a fresh take on a beloved classic, making it accessible and engaging for a new generation of gamers.

The game features 50 base levels and introduces players to nine different puzzle pieces, each with unique mechanics such as laser beams and teleporters. As players progress, they will encounter increasingly complex challenges that test their problem-solving skills and creativity. Fortell Games has also hinted at future level packs, ensuring that players will have plenty of content to explore beyond the initial offering.

While Enigmo is currently a timed exclusive for the Samsung Galaxy XR, there are plans to bring this innovative puzzler to Meta Quest headsets in the future. This cross-platform potential raises intriguing questions about the future of spatial gaming and how it can evolve to engage players in new and immersive ways. Are you ready to dive into the world of spatial puzzles?
